# Detecting Rumors And Single Source Of Rumors In Social Network Subgraphs

Social Networks are a broad platform for sharing information, images, videos,
and voice clips. Information spreads rapidly through social networks, but the
authenticity of the information is of significant concern. Prior verification for
authenticity is not done as the information propagates through the networks,
and there are higher chances for the information to be false or misleading.
Such incorrect information is termed Rumors. Identifying rumors has gained
more attention to restrain the spread of rumors and reduce their influence. It
is becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s age of social media and online
communication where false information or rumors can spread rapidly and
have significant consequences ranging from minor misinformation to major
public panic or damage to reputation.In this project, we deal with the identification of rumors and the source of rumors in snapshots of the social network
Twitter. The subgraphs obtained from Twitter have an average of 45 nodes
and 145 edges and represent smaller interaction networks. We only deal with
nodes that are actively interacting and not the passive nodes which could be
neighbors of these nodes. We explore graph properties to identify the source
of information propagated in the subgraph and also aim to determine the
presence of rumors in the subgraphs
